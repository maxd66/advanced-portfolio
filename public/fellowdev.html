                        <p> My name is Maxwell Dunn and I am a UCSD college graduate with a love for programming. I designed this section for all of the newer developers (like me) that are just getting started in their careers. I wanted to give any other developer that views this portfolio the opportunity to learn from some of my biggest mistakes and pitfalls, and from some of my successes and things that worked out really well. I developed the entire stack for this website, front and back end using html, css, and javascript, with the packages express, jest, sequelize, dotenv and mysql2.</p>
                        <p> Below is a description of all of my successes and failures while creating this web application. There are links to my Github in the nav bar and in the contact me section, and I will also put a link directly to the repository at the bottom of this section. Please, please check out the other pages, I hope you can gain something from them!</p>

                        <h2>Successes ðŸ¥³</h2>
                        <h4>Classes:</h4>
                        <p>Very early on I knew I wanted to take an object oriented approach for practice sake, and I think the biggest take away I have from it is this: Classes and object-oriented programming are very useful, when it makes sense to use them. Javascript is great because you don't have to make everything a class with an object and you should use that to your advantage when you can. I tried to make every action a method of some Class and it ended up just being more confusing, frustrating, and unneccessary for such a small project.</p>
                        <p>I used classes for generating html from stuff like form data and preset options, and for actually dynamically updating the page when I needed to, and any other functions I only needed to run once, or use in one spot were done on the page's dedicated script file. Doing it this way saved me time when I needed to do something I built a class for, and saved me headaches when I only needed a function in one spot.</p>
                        <h4>Animations:</h4>
                        <p>Animations, at least for me seemed very daunting when I first started learning html and css, but they are SO inuitive. CSS animations are really easy to use and are a good way, I think, to make your page seem more active and alive. Javascript animations are more customizable, but also more complicated to design so I almost exclusively used CSS for animations and have no regrets.</p>
                        <h4>The Server Side:</h4>
                        <p>I am very new to back-end development at the time of writing this, and am very pleased with how efficiently I created my server, and routes. All I can say about this one is that having old snippets of code is extremely useful, not just to copy and paste. I would often find an piece of code from a server I made before and just read it, understand it, and then go back to this page and make it again. It really helped my understanding of what everything was accomplishing, and now it is easier to remember, off the top of my head, goes where.</p>
                        <p>Sequelize is somewhat confusing, and the docs are hard to read through sometimes, but I just can't see myself ever making another sql database without it. My advice is to take the time, go through the docs, and once you think you understand them, just make a quick test server to run routes on and CRUD up your database. I also sometimes took the sequelize statement I made, and recreate it in the Mysql workbench just to make sure I really understood what I was doing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Failures ðŸ˜“</h2>
                        <p>I'd just like to preface by saying I am so happy that I have stuff to add to this column. Failure can be frustrating and heartbreaking, but it is absolutely the best way to learn. Every one of my failures taught me something, and I am a better developer now that I have made them, so I hope that you can learn from my failures without having to go through the heartbreak.</p>
                        <h4>Bootstrap and Custom CSS</h4>
                        <p>I learned very quickly that frameworks are not magic. They are powerful tools, but are definitely very far from perfect. The worst part is that they often override some default behaviors that might be useful for your custom CSS. I spent hours trying to get pieces from bootstrap to do exactly what I wanted, but ,at least for me, they only change so much. So what I took away from the experience is that I am going to use frameworks as you would any other tool, I'm going to customize it within it's own bounds, and not try to force it to do something it wasn't designed to. A wrench and hammer are both used to build houses, but trying to make a wrench do a hammer's job is just frustrating. </p>
                        <h4>Testing</h4>
                        <p>Test driven development is very useful, but difficult when starting out. The hardest part for me was just figuring out what to test for. And then even when I figured out what I wanted to test for, it was even more difficult to figure out how to write the test for it. This is definitely an area that I still want to improve, and will keep reading into and practicing.</p>
                        <h2>Summary</h2>
                        <p>All in all, I take everything from this page as a win. My successes brought me satisfaction and gratification, and my failures taught me lessons and showed me where I need to improve. If you made it this far, I hope you gained something from this, or maybe you have advice for how I can improve which I would greatly appreciate. Good luck, fellow Developer.</p>
