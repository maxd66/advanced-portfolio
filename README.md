# advanced-portfolio

This is an enhancement on my previous portfolio. It is more interactive and a better demonstration of my skills.
Deployed link on Heroku: https://mdd-portfolio.herokuapp.com/

## Description

My portfolio is a full stack web application that is designed to be like an interactive resume: Enjoyable to use, and concise and to the point. I designed my first portfolio to appeal to the future employers that might come across it, and while that is the most important aspect of a portfolio, I realized I had a much wider audience. Family and friends were visiting my website, and even some other developers. So, keeping them in mind I tried to design an experience that would cater to my entire audience. The last option in my portfolio is something I'm really excited about. It is an opportunity for me to show off my skills as a software developer, and talent and creativity. It is under construction and coming soon, but I hope everyone that visits can get the chance to come back and try it out when its done.

## Installation and Usage

There is no need for any installation, and the usage is relatively straightforward.

## Credits

I will say as you will see, that my goal of the last option of the portfolio was to pay homage to the games that have really impacted me, and the games referrenced were the games I felt I could do enough justice. That being said, a lot of the game is entirely my own creation. As far as the website itself, the entire stack was built by myself, and is currently deployed on Heroku.
